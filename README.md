# Portfolio Toolkit

Minimal notebook-first research toolkit for shared datasets, feature engineering, portfolio construction, backtesting, QuantStats reporting, and MLflow tracking.

This repo is intentionally small. It does not train models for your team. It gives everyone:

- the same datasets and split boundaries
- the same starter feature helpers and targets
- the same prediction and weight validation rules
- the same backtesting and statistics layer
- the same MLflow logging pattern

Your developers should still work in notebooks, choose their own model classes, write their own training loops, and experiment however they normally would.

## Quick Start

1. Review the starter ticker universes in `configs/datasets.toml` and change them if your team wants a different shared universe
2. Install with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. Join the team's Tailscale network so you can reach the shared MLflow host
4. Start with one of the committed notebook templates in `notebooks/templates/`
5. Load shared prices, build features, train your own model, emit predictions or weights, backtest, and log to MLflow

## Shared MLflow

The repo now defaults to the team's shared MLflow tracking URL:

- `https://adams-macbook-pro.tail5ddc35.ts.net`

That means `init_mlflow()` and `start_run(...)` will log to the same shared tracking server for everyone by default.

If you need to override it temporarily on your own machine, set:

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<another-uri>
```

Starter datasets included:

- `shared_set_1`
  Full S&P 500 universe
- `shared_set_2`
  Growth/tech/innovation universe
- `shared_set_3`
  Defensive/quality/value universe

## Validation Checks

Run targeted validation checks when you want to sanity-check a notebook output before sharing results:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_prediction_contract.py
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_portfolio_validation.py
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_backtest_and_mlflow_smoke.py
```
